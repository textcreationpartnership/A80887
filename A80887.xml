            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Speech of his Excellency the Lord General Cromwel, in Weſtminſter Hall on Friday laſt, to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable the Lord Mayor of the City of London, and the reſt of the Judges of the Law, upon their inveſting of Him Lord Protector of the three Nations of England, Scotland, and Ireland.</head>
            <p>WHereas the late Parliament having upon their Diſſolution delivered up their Power and Authorities, which they received from his Excellency at their firſt ſitting by a Writing under their Hands and Seals: His Excellency thereupon called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Officers, and adviſed with other perſons of Intereſt in the Nation, how this great Burthen of governing England, Scotland, and Ireland, ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118119:3"/>be born, and by whom; who after ſeveral Dayes ſeeking of God, and adviſing therein; It was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a Councel of godly able and diſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould be named, conſiſting of 21. And that his Excellency ſhould be choſen Lord Protector of the three Nations. In purſuance hereof, ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of eminency and worth, are already made choice of to be of the ſaid Councel. And on Friday laſt his Excellency went to Weſtminſter, where he was inſtalled Lord Protector of the three Nations; a Narration whereof take as followeth:</p>
            <p>His Excellency about one of the clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon went from White-Hall to Weſtminſter, to the Chancery Court, attended by the Lords Commiſſioners of the great Seal of England, Barons of the Exchequer, and Judges in their Robes; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, the Councel of the Common-wealth, and the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Recorder of the City of London, in their ſcarlet Gowns; then came his Excellency, attended with many of the chief Officers of the Army, and a Chair of State being ſet in the ſaid Court of Chancery, His Excellency ſtood on the left hand thereof uncovered, till a large Writing in Parchment, in the nature of an Oath, was read; the ſubſtance wherof was, That he ſhould govern the three Nations of England, Scotland, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118119:3"/>Ireland, according to the Fundamental Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; That he ſhould maintain the true Orthodox Miniſtery of the Church of England; and that He ſhould extirpate and aboliſh all Popery, Schiſmes, and Hereſie; and maintain and preſerve the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Rights, Priviledges, and Liberty, &amp;c. Unto which Paper, or Oath, his Excellency ſubſcribed in the face of the court, ſaying, to this effect, That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was the will of God, and the pleaſure of the council, that he ſhould be inveſted with ſo great an honour, as to be Lord Protector, that he deſired to rule and govern the three Nations no longer, then it might have a perfect dependancie on the great work of the Lord; that ſo the Goſpel might flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in its full ſplendor and purity; and the people enjoy their juſt Rights and Propriety? His Speech being ended, he ſate down in the chair covered; and the Lords comiſſioners then delivered up the great Seal of England to his Excellency, and the L. Major his Sword and cap of Maintenance; all which his Excellency returned immediatly to them again: the court then roſe, and his Excellency was attended back as aforeſaid, to the Banquetting houſe in VVhite-hall, the Lord Mayor himſelf uncovered carrying the Sword before the Protector all the way; and coming in to the Banqueting houſe, there was great acclamations of joy.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118119:4"/>
            <p>So that now this Common-wealth is become the Wonder and Emulation of Europe; nay, of the whole World: ſince that the Lord Protector is reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintain our National Rights, Lawes, Liberties, and Priviledges, againſt all ſorts of perſons whatſoever that ſhall dare to attempt the violation or extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. And indeed, deplorable is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, to behold the bird-witted Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of this Age, who already begin to breath forth a diſowning and diſlike of this great and unparallel'd Change. Alas! how great a madneſs are theſe Antinomies cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with, who blindly endeavor the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of ſo prudent a Governor, ſo excellent a Protector. Defend Us, O God! from that unhappineſs, where our own Reaſon wil not be our friend! We have nothing amiſs almoſt in England, but where our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118119:4"/>wholeſome Lawes, and excellent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is abuſed. Alas! how is the whole body of men wel compos'd, but valuing their Patrial Laws, are troubled at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Change. But doubtleſs, our Protector wil conſider, that in theſe Impreſſions of idle heads, their own Intereſt ſuffers an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly violation. Can it be, that ever theſe lunatick Braines wil be conſtant to their Governors, who not knovving vvhat to ask, yet are reſolved upon impetuous malice againſt thoſe Conſtitutions they breath under, and vvould involve the Common-Wealth into inextricable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birynthes.</p>
